      <h2>Understanding Scalable AI</h2>
      <p>Building AI solutions that can grow with your business requires careful planning, robust architecture, and a deep understanding of both current needs and future requirements.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase 1: Assessment and Planning</h2>
      <h3>Business Objectives Alignment</h3>
      <p>Start by clearly defining how AI will support your business goals. Identify specific use cases where AI can provide measurable value.</p>
      
      <h3>Data Readiness Evaluation</h3>
      <p>Assess the quality, quantity, and accessibility of your data. Clean, well-organized data is the foundation of any successful AI implementation.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase 2: Architecture Design</h2>
      <h3>Modular Approach</h3>
      <p>Design your AI system with modular components that can be independently updated, scaled, or replaced as your needs evolve.</p>
      
      <h3>Cloud-Native Solutions</h3>
      <p>Leverage cloud platforms for their scalability, managed services, and global infrastructure capabilities.</p>
      
      <h2>Phase 3: Implementation Best Practices</h2>
      <h3>Start Small, Scale Fast</h3>
      <p>Begin with a pilot project to prove value and learn, then rapidly scale successful implementations across your organization.</p>
      
      <h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3>
      <p>Implement robust monitoring and feedback loops to ensure your AI systems continue to perform optimally as they scale.</p>
      
      <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
      <p>Avoid these common mistakes: neglecting data governance, underestimating infrastructure requirements, and failing to plan for model retraining and updates.</p>
